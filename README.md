# TripDivvy
_Coming to the App Store soon!_

## What it is
A [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app for splitting trip expenses among friends.
Development of this app was for fun/learning; PRs welcome!

**Note:** components have been chosen to work well with both iOS and Android,
but the app is currently untested on Android. That's an exercise for you, the reader.

Is this your first React Native app? Want more context?
